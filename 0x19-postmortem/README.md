Postmortem Report: Security Incident - "TaskMaster" Application
Issue Summary:
Duration: 3 hours 17 minutes (March 4, 2025, 14:03 PST - March 4, 2025, 17:20 PST)
Impact: The TaskMaster application experienced a security breach, resulting in unauthorized access to user data. Users experienced intermittent service disruptions, including inability to log in and display of inaccurate task information. Approximately 15% of active users were affected.
Root Cause: SQL injection vulnerability in the task search functionality allowed attackers to bypass authentication and extract user data.
Timeline:
14:03 WAT: Monitoring system alerted to unusual database read activity originating from a single IP address.
14:08 WAT: Customer Support began receiving reports of login failures and data display issues.
14:15 WAT: On-call engineer (David) started investigating the database read activity and correlated it with customer support reports.
14:30 WAT: Initial assumption: increased load on the database server. Investigation focused on server resource utilization and query optimization.
15:00 WAT: Database performance appeared normal. David escalated the issue to the Security team (Sarah).
15:30 WAT: Sarah identified suspicious SQL queries in the database logs.
16:00 WAT: SQL injection vulnerability confirmed in the task search functionality.
16:30 WAT: Sarah implemented a temporary firewall rule to block traffic from the malicious IP address.
17:00 WAT: Code fix developed and tested to sanitize task search input.
17:20 WAT: Code fix deployed. Service restored to normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The TaskMaster application's task search functionality was vulnerable to SQL injection. User-supplied search terms were not properly sanitized before being used in database queries. This allowed attackers to inject malicious SQL code, bypassing authentication and gaining access to sensitive user data. Specifically, the vulnerability existed in the search_tasks endpoint.
Resolution: The immediate resolution involved two steps: 1) Blocking the malicious IP address at the firewall level to prevent further data exfiltration. 2) Deploying a code fix that implemented proper sanitization of user input in the search_tasks endpoint, preventing SQL injection. The fix used parameterized queries to ensure that user input was treated as data, not executable code.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements:
Enhance input validation across the entire application.
Implement regular security audits and penetration testing.
Improve monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious database activity more quickly.
Provide security training for developers on secure coding practices.
Tasks:
 Conduct a thorough code review to identify and fix any other potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
 Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to provide an additional layer of security.
 Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
 Set up real-time alerts for unusual database access patterns (e.g., excessive data retrieval, failed login attempts).
 Schedule annual security training for all development staff, focusing on OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities.
 Investigate and implement a more robust user authentication system, potentially including multi-factor authentication.
